  Random Steam Wishlist Game Picker (RSWGP)

  For those of you who have too many games in their wishlist and don't know what to play.

<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  RSWGP is a project I made out of boredom and because I'm one of those people who have too many games in their wishlist and still don't know what to play. This also exists because I couldn't find a website for this (I         probably was blind and didn't see the result in Google). This is a simple Next.js app with a route handler that fetches your Steam ID, fetches your profile's wishlist and randomly picks a game that you should play.

<h1>Hosting your own instance</h1>
<p>
  In order for the website to work properly, you'll need to supply a Steam Web API key and yes, if you forget to provide it, the website will yell at you. You can create one here: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey.
  After that, you can pretty much deploy this wherever you want like Vercel, Netlify and whatever server environments exist these days (you'll probably need to make use of OpenNext to deploy on AWS or any of those platforms though).
